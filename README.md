# Box-Plot-Fitting
This program was created to take in light data from a star with an orbiting planet and determine the planets period.


This program is currently my project for my senior capstone. One of the ways exoplanets can be discovered is by examining the change in light caused by the planet moving infront of the star. This program uses light data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The idea is to treat the transit as a box plot. By running though various values that determine the box plot and picking the combination of values that minimize the least square value.
